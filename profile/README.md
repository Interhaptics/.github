👋 We are Interhaptics! A team of gaming and haptic enthusiasts, a team which made a design tool, an engine, SDKs and whole bunch of APIs for game devs to create powerful haptic effects for all platforms. 🎮📱🥽

Interhaptics is a haptic software for game development. The only tool you need is to create and render HD and non-HD haptics for mobile, Consoles, and XR.  

We have reshaped Interhaptics to best fit your needs and have made it available directly here on GitHub. Understanding the frustrations of developing haptics made us create the designer and the engine that powers it all.  

We wanted to experience haptics on all platforms, all peripherals, and all technologies without developing verticalized effects for each one. We come to you with 8 commercially supported platforms today and will be releasing a lot more in the future!
